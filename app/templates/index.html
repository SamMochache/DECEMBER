            <h2>About Me – The Art of Simplicity & Security</h2>
            <p>When I wrote my first line of code, I wasn’t just building software—I was building a future. A future where technology works seamlessly, securely, and beautifully.

            <br>I’m Sam Mochache, a Full-Stack Developer with expertise in Django, Flask, DRF, and SQLite. But beyond the code, I believe in crafting experiences—ones that feel effortless, intuitive, and powerful.
                
                <br>My journey began with Network Engineering, where I learned the importance of structure, security, and reliability. That foundation led me into DevSecOps and Cloud Computing, where I mastered the art of scalable and secure architectures.
                
                Today, I bridge development and security, writing clean, elegant code that doesn’t just work—it thrives. Because technology should never feel complicated; it should feel like second nature.
                
                I don’t just build applications—I create solutions that connect, protect, and inspire.</p>
